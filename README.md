# My dot files

I use zsh with [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) because zinit is fast, allows to use Oh My Zsh (slow and bad) plugins and libs while also looking good because it's unreasonably complicated.

The `brews` file contains all the brew formulae I'm using.

The `iterm-profile.json` file is an export of my iTerm profile with the color schema (Snazzy) and font I like to use (MesloLGS NF).
